# PetCareJSApp
Single Page Application Project - Pet Care 
This was an Exam Work given from SoftUni for us to create a Single Page Application using JavaScript and any other method that we decided it would work fine.
The Backend server was provided by SoftUni, so this was a purely the work for the Frontend.

I decided to use different modules e.g: 
page.mjs (to easily navigate through the different pages),
lit-html.js (for the work in the html of the spa)
