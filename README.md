# PetCareJSApp
This was an Exam work given from SoftUni to create a Single Page Application using JavaScript and any other method that would fit with the task.
The Backend server was provided by SoftUni, so this was a purely the work for the Frontend.

I decided to use different JS modules e.g: 
page.mjs (to easily navigate through the different pages),
lit-html.js (for the work in the html of the spa)
